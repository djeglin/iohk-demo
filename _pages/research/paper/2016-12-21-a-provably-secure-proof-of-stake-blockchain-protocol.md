<blockquote>We present a provably-secure blockchain protocol based on “proof of stake.” As far as we are aware, this is the first proof of stake blockchain protocol which provides rigorous security guarantees.</blockquote>

The security properties of the system are analyzed in the model of [9] and are comparable to the ones possessed by the bitcoin blockchain protocol which utilizes proof of work. Furthermore, an incentive mechanism for the protocol is also proposed.
