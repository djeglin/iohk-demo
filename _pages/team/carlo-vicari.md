Carlo Vicari returned to New York City in 2014 to take the lead as business development manager for an advanced laboratory services corporation. During this time, he cultivated relationships with numerous public and private universities. As project lead, he succeeded in building a strong foundation for the company to begin growth after years of stagnation.

Working with many different departments, situations and personalities has given him an excellent skill set to effectively manage the challenges IOHK presents him with.
