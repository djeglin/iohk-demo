Radek has been developing in Scala since 2012 for a number of commercial clients. Having started his adventure with programming at the age of 13, this was a natural choice of career path. However, heâ€™s always had a fondness for abstract and pure ideas, which is why he is especially keen on working in a field so heavily reliant on mathematics. Outside of work he actively enjoys various sports, especially cycling and fitness, as well as those for the mind, like chess and his latest passion, cue sports.
