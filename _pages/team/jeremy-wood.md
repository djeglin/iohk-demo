Immediately upon finishing Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, Jeremy Wood packed a suitcase and bought a one-way ticket to Asia. Living in Osaka, Japan since 2008 Jeremy was bitten by the crypto-bug in 2013 and is a founding member of the Kansai Bitcoin Meet-up. He soon became entranced by the potential of next generation blockchains and joined Ethereum at the end of 2013, managing operations.

After leaving Ethereum, Jeremy consulted on cryptocurrencies before starting Input Output with Charles Hoskinson in 2015.

Jeremy believes that the future of fintech will progress only through experimentation and research, and by promoting collaboration between diverse groups and organizations.
