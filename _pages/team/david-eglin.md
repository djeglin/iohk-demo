David is a front-end veteran of 15+ years, having delivered large-scale web projects for major brands such as Jaguar Land Rover, Argos, Nike & Bentley. Whilst his background is from large marketing and advertising agencies, David chose to come to IOHK to make a difference in the world. 

He is an active supporter and contributor to a number of static site generators, and has also worked with a number of headless, API-based CMSes to make the world of static websites accessible to less technical staff members. 

David works within the creative team at IOHK, where he evangelises the adoption of new technologies and best practises.
