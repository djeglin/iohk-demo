Alexander Vieth holds a degree in mathematics and computer science from McGill University. Upon graduation in 2013, he helped to build a successful cloud-based graphics and CAD tool now under development by Autodesk. Never satisfied with the state of the art, he believes that pure functional programming with static types is a promising avenue towards improved software quality and development processes.
