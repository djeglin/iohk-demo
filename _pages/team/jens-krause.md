Jens is a Senior Software Developer with 17 years of experience in the industry. After doing OOP for more than a decade he moved into the world of Functional Programming. Today he is focused on PureScript, Haskell and Elm.

At his spare-time you will find him at the Baltic Sea kitesurfing, longboarding or doing calisthenics all year long. He has also great interests in permaculture and is growing sprouts and wheatgrass at home to harvest his own superfood every day.
