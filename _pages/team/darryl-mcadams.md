Darryl is a type theorist and functional programmer who occasionally dabbles in AI and linguistic theory. He's an advocate of using formal methods, especially dependent types and novel type systems, for building provably correct software. He has implemented a number of pure functional programming languages, including ones with temporal logic quasiquotation and delimited continuations. He also advocates for good documentation of software, especially literate documentation where possible.
