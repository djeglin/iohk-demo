Jane Wild joined IOHK as communications director in 2017 after seven years as a journalist at the Financial Times in London. Her interest in all things crypto was sparked in 2013 when she began reporting on bitcoin and blockchain for the FT, where she worked as a reporter and commissioning editor. She is inspired by the possibilities of the blockchain to create fairer systems for people.

Jane holds a law degree from Kingâ€™s College London and a Masters in Journalism from Goldsmiths, University of London. She has lived in London and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
