Jacob is an experienced engineer with BSc degrees in both mathematics
and computer science. Like many engineers he is concerned that systems
tend to get more complex and less maintainable over time. For projects
with well understood objectives, he anticipates academic approaches like
programming language semantics, type theory, and formal verification
will be necessary to assure correctness and security. To that end he
enjoys studying languages like Coq, Haskell, Idris, and miniKanren.
