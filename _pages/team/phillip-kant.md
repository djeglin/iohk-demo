Dr. Philipp Kant obtained his PhD in theoretical physics from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.  He spent six years as a researcher, studying the Higgs boson, top quarks, and developing algorithms for calculations in perturbative quantum field theory.

Since 2014, he is working in software development, using primarily Haskell for projects in areas such as distributed computing, data management, and econometrics.  He joined IOHK in 2017.
