Jonn Mostovoy loves mathematics and social sciences; he has ten years of experience in industrial programming. In the spare time Jonn likes to think about and discuss matters of societal structures and governance models, along with the matters of alternative societies and self-governing entities.

In his work, Jonn Mostovoy performs duties of technical management of Serokell team, which is the core developer team of IOHK, industrial research, and programming.

Jonn Mostovoy is an advocate for the wide adoption of functional programming languages, using mostly Haskell as a reasonable trade-off between industrial requirements and type system expressiveness.
