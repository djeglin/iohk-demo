Artyom is a Haskell developer who particularly likes teaching â€“ he's the author of several popular tutorials, among which is a rambly but entertaining Lens Over Tea. While most of his work is about making Haskell more usable for others, he also enjoys thinking about UX, inventing ideas for imaginary startups, writing short bios, and turning everything into self-referential humor (especially where it's not appropriate to do so).
