I graduated from St.-Petersburg state University with specialization in Computer Science. My interests include compilers, logics, theorem proving and related concepts. I started as a programmer, worked in software companes in Russia and USA, but later my interests moved to more academic area. Now I am teaching and doing research in ITMO University, St. Petersburg.
