Tomislav Horaček has been working with web technologies since 2011 and holds a Master of Computer Engineering degree from Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Information Technology in University of Osijek, Croatia. He started his professional career as a back-end PHP developer, but moved to front-end development as he discovered his love towards modern Javascript Frameworks such as ReactJS; these remain his main focus to this day.

Tomislav has great passion for writing modular, component-based code that is independent, reusable and easy to extend.
