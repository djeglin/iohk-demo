<h2 class="margint0">Be the Cause of Disruption</h2>

<blockquote>IOHK is a company focused on decentralization and disruption, and the people that enable us to do so are no exception either. With operations in Hong Kong, Japan and Eastern Europe, and employees and partners from Latvia, the Netherlands, Austria, France, Ukraine, Argentina and Brazil in addition to its multinational core members, IOHK is a truly global company despite its small, overall size and short history. We not only aim to cause disruption with our technology, but also with the way we organize a group of talented and motivated people around the same vision and passion.</blockquote>

<h2>Work with Us!</h2>

We are always looking for talented and motivated people to join our team, and more importantly to collaborate with. Our goal is to cause cascading disruptions and there are many ways to be a part of it. If you feel like you have something to contribute, whether directly to IOHK or one of its projects, please do not hesitate to <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>.
