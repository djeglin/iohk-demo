---
RS|Coin proposesÂ¹ a framework to implement centrally banked monetary
systems based on cryptographic methods in such way that it is possible
for a system which uses RS|Coin framework to meet every of the following
criteria:

  1. The system can handle a massive amount of users and scales well.
  2. Transaction times are comparable to those of Mastercard and other
     payment systems that issue plastic cards.
  3. The system is auditable and transparent for all users.
  4. The system allows rapid payments in which instruments are sent between
     two or more commercial banks or other payment systems, which don't
     have a partnership agreement. Compliance is ensured by the protocol and no direct communication between the systems
     of those banks or payment systems is required.
  5. For central banks and other possible governors of monetary supply,
     RS|Coin provides a way to focus on this, off-loading transaction
     handling to commercial banks and other governed entities.
  6. With a simple extension, RS|Coin provides a way to perform extremely
     fast international transactions with no need for manual work and
     correspondent banks.

## Platform support

At the moment, the only supported platform is Linux. Mac OS X isn't
officially supported, but it should be possible to deploy and run RS|Coin
on Mac OS X the same way as it is done on Linux.

Windows will be supported at some point, but for now we don't have a
milestone for that.
